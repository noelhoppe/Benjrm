# API-related documentation

## OpenAPI Specification (OAS)
- Industry-standard format (a YAML or JSON file) for describing RESTFUL APIs.
- Defines your API's endpoints, parameters, request/response formats, and more.
- Acts as a machine-readable contract between your API and its consumers.
- Because it is machine-readable, it can be used to automatically generate
  documentation (like *Swagger UI*), client and server code (like *Swagger Codegen*) and even test cases (like *Dredd*).

## Spectral
- A JSON/YAML linter with out of the box support for OpenAPI 3.x & 2.0 specifications
- Refer to the [Spectral documentation](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/674b27b261c3c-overview) for more details,
especially the [OpenAPI ruleset](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/4dec24461f3af-open-api-rules)

### Run locally
Run Spectral against the [OpenAPI specification (OAS)](../openapispec/RestInterface.yaml) using the following command locally 
from the root directory of the repository:
```bash
spectral lint docs/openapispec/RestInterface.yaml --fail-severity warn
```

Ensure that you have installed the [Spectral CLI client](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/9ffa04e052cc1-spectral-cli) globally using npm before running the above command:
```bash
npm install -g @stoplight/spectral-cli
```

### Integrated into CI-Pipeline
Spectral - an open-source API style guide enforcer and linter - is integrated into the CI pipeline.
It runs on every pull request and pushes to main branch modifying either the [OpenAPI specification (OAS)](../openapispec/RestInterface.yaml)
or the [workflow file itself](../../.github/workflows/spectral.yaml).

> For further details on how Spectral in integrated into the CI pipeline, please refer to
> the [GitHub Actions workflow file](../../.github/workflows/spectral.yaml).

After pushing to a pull request you can review the Spectral linting results in the "Files changed" tab, especially 
in the file `docs/openapispec/RestInterface.yaml`

or in the "Checks" tab under the "Run Spectral on Pull Requests" workflow.

## Swagger
- Refers to the tooling ecosystem (like Swagger UI, Swagger Editor, and Swagger Codegen)
  that helps you design, visualize, and interact with APIs based on that spec.


### API documentation with *Swagger UI*

1. Every API endpoint is documented within the [OpenAPI Specification (OAS)](../openapispec/RestInterface.yaml)

2. OpenAPI Specification (OAS) can be previewed in JetBrains IDEs
![](assets/preview-openapispec-jetbrains.png)
![](assets/preview-openapispec-jetbrains-01.png)

3. Swagger UI displays the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) in an interactive format
and gets automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when the `main` branch is updated *and* files *either*
in the `docs/openapispec/**` directory *or* the workflow file `.github/workflows/openapispec.yaml` are changed.

You can find the currently deployed version of the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) in an interactive format using Swagger UI [here](https://benjrm.github.io/Benjrm)

> For further details on how the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is deployed to GitHub Pages in an interactive format using
> Swagger UI, please refer to the [GitHub Actions workflow file](../../.github/workflows/openapispec.yaml).
