# API-related documentation

## OpenAPI Specification (OAS)
- Industry-standard format (a YAML or JSON file) for describing RESTFUL APIs.
- Defines your API's endpoints, parameters, request/response formats, and more.
- Acts as a machine-readable contract between your API and its consumers.
- Because it is machine-readable, it can be used to automatically generate
  documentation (like *Swagger UI*), client and server code (like *Swagger Codegen*) and even test cases (like *Dredd*).

## Swagger
- Refers to the tooling ecosystem (like Swagger UI, Swagger Editor, and Swagger Codegen)
  that helps you design, visualize, and interact with APIs based on that spec.

### API documentation with *Swagger UI*

1. Every API endpoint is documented within the [OpenAPI Specification (OAS)](../openapispec/RestInterface.yaml)

2. OpenAPI Specification (OAS) can be previewed in IDEs either by using a plugin to visualize the
   OAS in an interactive format directly or by previewing the `index.html` file in the `docs/openapispec/` directory,
   which is generated using Swagger UI and references the OAS file.

3. Swagger UI displays the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) in an interactive format
   and gets automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when the `main` branch is updated *and* files *either*
   in the `docs/openapispec/**` directory *or* the workflow file `.github/workflows/openapispec.yaml` are changed.

You can find the currently deployed version of the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) in an interactive format using Swagger UI [here](https://benjrm.github.io/Benjrm)

> For further details on how the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is deployed to GitHub Pages in an interactive format using
> Swagger UI, please refer to the [GitHub Actions workflow file](../../.github/workflows/openapispec.yaml).


## Spectral
- A JSON/YAML linter with out of the box support for OpenAPI 3.x & 2.0 specifications
- Refer to the [Spectral documentation](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/674b27b261c3c-overview) for more details,
especially the [OpenAPI ruleset](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/4dec24461f3af-open-api-rules)

### Run locally
Run Spectral against the [OpenAPI specification (OAS)](../openapispec/RestInterface.yaml) using the following command locally 
from the root directory of the repository:
```bash
spectral lint docs/openapispec/RestInterface.yaml --fail-severity warn
```

Ensure that you have installed the [Spectral CLI client](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/9ffa04e052cc1-spectral-cli) globally using npm before running the above command:
```bash
npm install -g @stoplight/spectral-cli
```

### Integrated into CI-Pipeline
Spectral - an open-source API style guide enforcer and linter - is integrated into the CI pipeline.
It runs on every pull request and pushes to main branch modifying either the [OpenAPI specification (OAS)](../openapispec/RestInterface.yaml)
or the [workflow file itself](../../.github/workflows/spectral.yaml).

> For further details on how Spectral in integrated into the CI pipeline, please refer to
> the [GitHub Actions workflow file](../../.github/workflows/spectral.yaml).

After pushing to a pull request you can review the Spectral linting results in the "Files changed" tab, especially 
in the file `docs/openapispec/RestInterface.yaml`
or in the "Checks" tab under the "Run Spectral on Pull Requests" workflow.

## Development

### Dummy Login Endpoint
In [#38](https://github.com/Benjrm/Benjrm/pull/38), a dummy login endpoint was introduced for development and debugging purposes. This endpoint is only available in debug builds and is not included in release builds.

When performing a GET request to `/auth/login/dummy/{id}`, where `{id}` is a placeholder for a dummy ID, the endpoint will log the user in as `dummy_user_{id}` (e.g. via `/auth/login/dummy/0` as `dummy_user_0`), creating or fetching the corresponding database user and establishing a session. It is useful for simplifying local development workflows and testing with tools like Postman or Bruno, where full authentication flows are unnecessary.

After a successful request, the user is not redirected and must manually navigate to the desired page or route. This endpoint is strictly for local development and can't be used in production environments.
